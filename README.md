# Chat Rooms With Loco

In this guide, we will walk through the process of creating chat rooms using Loco and [socketioxide](https://github.com/Totodore/socketioxide). The example website is derived from the [socketioxide example]((https://github.com/Totodore/socketioxide/tree/main/examples)).


## Running the Example
```sh
cargo loco start

```

After the server starts, open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5150 to access the chat rooms.
